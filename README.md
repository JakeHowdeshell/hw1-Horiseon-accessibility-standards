# Project Title

UT Fullstack Bootcamp Homework 1; Horiseon webpage HTML and CSS debugging project.

# Project Description

Using an exmple image of the webpage and the following user story:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Alterations were made to properly name the elements in the HTML file and condensing the CSS code so there were no redundant styles and it was cascading in the same fashion as the HTML file in order to fit the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

Changed the <dev> tags withing the HTML structure to the correct semantic HTML elements given their location and provided code.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Made sure there was an accurate logic structure using the updated semantic HTML elements.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

Added an alt= discription to each image element provided within the webpage. Using the crome dev tools then deleted the image provided to confirm the alternative image discription would appear.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

Confirmed that the heading attributes started at h1, the main body had h2 headings, and the aside section of the document contained h3 headings. Updated the footer headings from h2 to h3 to align with the order of importance.

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Updated the webpage title to reflect the name of the company as well place an emphasis on the main content provided on this webpage.

Additionaly two new CSS class's were created: .content article h2 & .content article p to alter the width and positioning of their container so that the text would display visaully the same as the provided image. display:none attribute was also added to the class: .footer so that the footer would no longer display, as represented in the provided example picture. All changes made are noted in both the HTML and CSS files to be more accurately tracked.
